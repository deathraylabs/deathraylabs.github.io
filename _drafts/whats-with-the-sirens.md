# Figuring Out What's Going On

> Does anyone know why that helicopter keeps circling overhead? What's with all the sirens I keep hearing?

I see these questions come up a lot on the Nextdoor and Neighbors apps, so I figured I should compile a list of resources that you can use to help answer the question "what's going on?". I don't want to discourage folks from posting to Nextdoor or Neighbors apps when they here something, because ultimately community is the best defense we have against crime, as well as the first source for assistance in an emergency.

Here's the list of websites and resources I've found helpful in the past, in order I _usually_ check them:

#### [City of Houston Active Incidents](https://cohweb.houstontx.gov/ActiveIncidents/Combined.aspx?agency=%)

- Generic list of motor vehicle incidents, medical emergencies, traffic hazards, and fires. Includes location, call time, and responding HFD units.
- Usually posted within a few minutes of incident.
- Generic but the HFD(fire) button shows units on scene (gives indication of severity), and HPD (Police) lists accident severity.
- "Fatality" accidents usually involve lengthy investigations, so expect the road to be closed for hours. HPD twitter account will often also provide details.


#### [HPD Twitter Account](https://mobile.twitter.com/houstonpolice)

- Major incidents and follow-up are often posted here before the local news posts.
- Usually only homicides and major accidents make it up quickly.
